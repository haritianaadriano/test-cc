## Before refactor

. addRice() => 0(1) 

    1. Time complexity: 0(1) because it only check
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. cookRice() => 0(1) 

    1. Time complexity: 0(1) because it only check
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. steam() => 0(1) 

    1. Time complexity: 0(1) because it only check
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. keepWarm() => 0(1) 

    1. Time complexity: 0(1) because it only check
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. removeRice() => 0(1) 

    1. Time complexity: 0(1) because it only check
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. delaySync() => 0(ms) , 0(1)

    1. Time complexity: 0(ms) because it depends on input
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. simulateRiceCooker() => 0(n) , 0(1)

    1. Time complexity: 0(n) where n is the number of time where user enter input
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

    1. Time complexity: 0(1) because it only check
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)

. simulateRiceCooker() => 0(n) , 0(1)

    1. Time complexity: 0(n) where n is the number of time where user enter input
    2. Space complexity: 0(1)
